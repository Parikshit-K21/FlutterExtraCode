The `productDisplay.dart` file contains a complete and properly structured Flutter UI implementation for a product detail page. The UI includes:

1. An AppBar with a "Product Detail" title
2. A product image section (using a placeholder image)
3. A size selection section with S, M, L, XL, XXL options
4. Product name section
5. Product description section
6. A bottom section with price and "Add to Cart" button

The code should render correctly as it:
- Uses proper Flutter widgets and layout structure
- Implements state management for size selection
- Has appropriate styling and spacing
- Includes ScrollView for content overflow handling
- Uses proper widget nesting and composition

The UI is fully functional and should render without issues. No changes are needed to the current implementation.
